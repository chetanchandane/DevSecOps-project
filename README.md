# Cloud-based CI/CD Pipeline with AWS, Jenkins, and Docker

This project demonstrates the setup of a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using AWS EC2, Jenkins, and Docker. It automates the build, testing, and deployment process for a Node.js application using Docker containers, all managed through Jenkins. The pipeline integrates with GitHub to automatically trigger builds on code changes, ensuring efficient development workflows and rapid delivery.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to deploy a scalable and automated CI/CD pipeline in the cloud using industry-standard tools and best practices. By utilizing Jenkins for automation, Docker for containerization, and AWS EC2 for hosting, the pipeline can efficiently manage the build and deployment of applications with minimal manual intervention.

### Key Features

- AWS EC2 Setup: Provisioned an EC2 instance to host Jenkins, configure security groups, and manage cloud infrastructure for application deployment.
  
- Jenkins Installation & Configuration: Installed Jenkins on the EC2 instance, set up necessary plugins, and integrated with GitHub for version control.

- Automated Build Process: Configured Jenkins to automatically trigger builds using GitHub Webhooks upon code push or pull requests.

- Docker Integration: Created a Dockerfile for the application, allowing Jenkins to build and deploy the app in a containerized environment, ensuring consistency across different platforms.

- Continuous Deployment: Automated the deployment process by running the application in Docker containers, with Jenkins managing the entire lifecycle from code to production.

### Steps Involved

1. AWS EC2 Setup  
   - Created an EC2 instance to host the Jenkins server.
   - Configured the security group to open necessary ports (8080 for Jenkins and 8000 for the application).

2. Jenkins Installation & Initial Configuration  
   - Installed Jenkins on the EC2 instance and set up the initial configuration, including admin credentials.
   - Installed required plugins for GitHub and Docker integration.

3. GitHub Integration  
   - Generated GitHub credentials and integrated the repository with Jenkins.
   - Set up webhooks to trigger Jenkins jobs automatically on new commits or pull requests.

4. Application Deployment  
   - Installed Node.js on the EC2 instance to run the application.
   - Created a Dockerfile for containerizing the Node.js application.
   - Configured Jenkins to build the Docker image, run the container, and deploy the app.

5. Automation with Jenkins  
   - Created a Jenkins pipeline to automate the entire CI/CD process.
   - Configured build triggers using GitHub webhooks.
   - Managed and monitored builds, automated deployments, and environment setup through Jenkins jobs.

### Tools & Technologies Used

- Amazon Web Services (AWS): EC2 instances for hosting Jenkins and the application.
- Jenkins: Automation server for building and managing CI/CD pipelines.
- Docker: Containerization tool for creating consistent application environments.
- GitHub: Source control and version management system.
- Node.js: Backend application framework used in this project.

### How to Run This Project

1. Clone the Repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chetanchandane/node-todo/tree/main
   ```
2. Launch the EC2 Instance  
   Provision an EC2 instance on AWS with the necessary security groups to allow access to Jenkins (port 8080) and the application (port 8000).

3. Install Jenkins  
   Follow the official Jenkins installation guide to set up Jenkins on the EC2 instance.

4. Configure Jenkins  
   Install necessary plugins (GitHub, Docker) and link the repository using your GitHub credentials. Create a pipeline and configure GitHub webhooks to trigger builds automatically.

5. Run Docker Container  
   Build and deploy the application using Docker. Jenkins will handle the creation of the Docker image and run it as a container.

### Future Enhancements

- Implement SSL for secure communication between Jenkins and the application.
- Scale the infrastructure using AWS Elastic Load Balancing and Auto Scaling.
- Add automated testing steps in the Jenkins pipeline.
